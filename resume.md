## Currently

Participating in the Summer IDEaS program with Union College's Schaffer Library to gain experience in the digital humanities field, ultimately working with a team to produce scholarship relating to the college's history. Also beginning work on my senior thesis with Union's English and Gender, Sexuality, and Women's Studies departments, where I hope to focus on the "feminist" female lead in the emerging world of Young Adult fiction.
