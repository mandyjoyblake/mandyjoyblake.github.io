## Currently

Working on my senior thesis with Union's English and Gender, Sexuality, and Women's Studies departments, where I hope to focus on the "feminist" female lead in the emerging world of Young Adult fiction. 

## About Me 

Current and forever student of language, storytelling, and communication, no matter the format. 

As a rising senior at Union College, I believe that I have made the most of my past three years here, and I hope to continue to do so. Academically, I have found great success, earning a cumulative GPA of 3.98 in courses such as Literary Theory, Jane Austen, and The Beatles & African American Music. In taking these rather unconventional courses, I have refined my ability to not only write and speak effectively, but gain an acute sense of writing and creating content tailored to audience. I am further developing these skills with an education in the field of digital humanities, which you can read more about in my resume. 

In addition to academics, I have involved myself in a variety of different extracurricular activities and experiences at Union. In December of 2019, I traveled to London for an immersive study abroad focusing on West End theatre and British History, which certainly piqued my interest in more travel. During the spring of 2021, I participated in a global internship with a publishing house in Sydney, Australia that was fully remote due to the pandemic travel restrictions.
