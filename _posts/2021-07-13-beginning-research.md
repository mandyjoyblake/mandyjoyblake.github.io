Beginning during the session today, I started a preliminary search into the topics that I outlined in my last blog post: the 1828 election and Pearson's relgiious beliefs. Honestly, my head hurt a little at the end of it, and here's why. 

## Doing the Research and Relevant Struggles 
By selecting Pearson's early diary entries, I've (we've?) made the research part of this project a bit more difficult, but certainly not impossible by any means; it just rendered a lot of the sources that Lindsey put together for us a lot less relevant. Pearson was not located in Schenectady during this time, so I found that we did not have access to the same type of primary sources that are available in Schenectady. My research so far has been very stop and go in some parts as a result. For example, there's no centralized database for historical newspapers in New Hampshire, and the local historical societies have not digitized their records. 

## My Source and Connection 
I actually found a lot of potential sources, and have been placing them in a google doc by category of what I want to research: the election, town history, and religion. One source that I found that I want to highlight is the Waterville College Catalog from 1830; it has a record of Pearson's attendance and information on what he studied and how much it cost. This could give some great insight into what was considered important knowledge at the time and the socioeconomic status of Pearson and his family. The other source that I found was a history of Chichester, NH from the late 19th century. It has a record of the church that Pearson attended, which actually still exists today. With this information, I might be able to trace what denomination Pearson was, and therefore what his foundational beliefs were as a deeply religious person. I could then expand it to the great religious movement of the time known as the Great Awakening. 

Overall, I'm not that discouraged by my findings so far, especially since we had that dedicated time to do different searches after the lesson today.
