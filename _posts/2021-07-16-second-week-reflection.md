I really enjoyed the lessons and content from this second week because it was a lot more hands-on. It feels like we are really starting to get into the real content of the project and getting a clearer idea of what it might look like. 

## Copyright and Licensing 
I liked the first lesson of the week on copyright and licensing a lot because that is a field of law that I am potentially interested in. Not only that, but I think that digital licensing and copyright is something that everyone should know in a largely digital world; many people post content on social media, whether as a career or not, so it's crucial to 1) know your rights and 2) protect yourself. This could potentially connect to the larger conversation we had in the session today about the merits and demerits of social media. 

## Searching Through Union's History  
I also found our look through Union's archives and the discussions surrounding these itmes to be fascinating and very intellectaully stimulating. While not all of it was directly related to my research topics, I still think it was helpful to get a practice run at looking through the different types of materials avavilable to us, and to get Matt's perspective as to how to get creative with using often-incomplete historical records for our purposes. I found it beneficial that we spoke a great deal about what we found, even if it was only tangentially related, because it was helpful to hear feedback about what we could potentially cover with this project. I would like to focus on broadening a future reader's understanding of Pearson beyond the traditionally glorified view of him to see the good, the bad, and the ugly, as I've discovered through my reading that there was evidence of all 3 in his journals. 

Overall, this second week gave me a taste of the independent work that we will be doing, and I found that I rather liked it.
