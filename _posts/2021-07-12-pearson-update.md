As mentioned in the first week reflection post, I've noticed that the same topics appear again and again throughout my section in the Pearson diary, which raises the question of how best to research and incorporate this contextual material in the final project. 

## What Topics?
I think that the overall most important topic that I've found is researching religion in Pearson's life, because it was relevent both to his personal beliefs and just the time period in general. This is a very broad idea that can stem into a lot of different subtopics: Pearson's sect of christianity and what their beliefs were, religion in politics (especially local politics), how these beliefs applied to marginalized groups, i.e. were women and non-white men viewed as equal in the eyes of the church? could they hold positions of power? What impact did the church have on education? These are just a few of the questions that I had and wrote down while reading my section. 

Another potential topic that I found was on local politics and the military. There are several references to military rank and tradition throughout the text that I didn't understand, so if I did not understand it, then other potential readers might be the same. This context might help readers understand who held social amd political power at the time, adhering to this summer's theme.

Finally, since there are so many references to weather, I think that might be important to contextualize in terms of why Pearson might include it. Is it related to travel? Social niceties? Something else? I'd love to find out, since I found these sections to be confusing and repetitive. 

## Potential Next Steps 
I think I will need to find both primary and secondary sources in this research. Schaffer, and especially special collections, will probably be a great place to start with primary sources for all of the topics I've listed above. There will probably be information that could apply to the local area, since a lot of what I want to research is related closely to Pearson's life and where he was geographically. From there, I might be able to then look for secondary sources or outside primary sources to fill in any gaps that I might see, depending on where the research takes me.
