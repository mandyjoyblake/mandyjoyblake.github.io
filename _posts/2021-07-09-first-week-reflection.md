The first week of summer IDEaS came both upon us and to an end very quickly; we started the week with jumping right into the content, but due to the fourth of july weekend, it was only a 3 day week. However, we covered a lot of information in those three days, so I'm grateful for a short break in the form of the weekend. 

## My Experience and Process
I was actually surprised by the diverse topics that we covered so far, and how intellectually stimulating it has been. This is all very new to me, so I'm finding the material - like learning how to use programs such as this one - very engaging. I like the collaborative style of the experience and how often we are able to share opinions and ideas.  

## Pearson 
I am finding the Pearson text both surprising and not surprising in content. I am unsurprised that a lot of the content in the diaries could be potentially problematic from a modern perspective. Pearson was deeply religious, and often, although not always, that point of view carries deeply sexist, racist, and classist ideas that are then difficult to separate. Pearson might surprise me later. I am, however, a bit surprised at how repetitive it is - throughout my reading so far, I've picked up on a lot of the same events and areas to research, like the weather, church life, and 1828 politics. There is not a whole lot of variety, at least in my section. My concern, then, for the final project is how to best express these topics - in text annotations? A separate contextual section? Both?
