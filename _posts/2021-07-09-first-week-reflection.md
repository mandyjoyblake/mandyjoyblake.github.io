The first week of summer IDEaS came both upon us and to an end very quickly; we started the week with jumping right into the content, but due to the fourth of july weekend, it was only a 3 day week. However, we covered a lot of information in those three days, so I'm grateful for a short break in the form of the weekend. 

## My Experience and Process
I was actually surprised by the diverse topics that we covered so far, and how intellectually stimulating it has been. This is all very new to me, so I'm finding the material - like learning how to use programs such as this one - very engaging. I like the collaborative style of the experience and how often we are able to share opinions and ideas.  

## Pearson 
One concern of mine is certainly keeping up with the technology part. While I can certainly hold my own in reading, writing, and research, I am out of practice with technology and computer programs.
