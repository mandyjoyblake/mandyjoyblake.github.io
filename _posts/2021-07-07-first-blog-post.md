I would not exactly say that I am comfortable with digital or open scholarship, even after being published a few times now. However, I am excited to learn, as I think it is very valuable knowledge in a world where almost everything is published online. 

## Background in digital or open scholarship?
As I mentioned before, I have been published already. The first time was through my Literary Theory course at Union. I wrote some entries in the dictionary as part of my final project and the book should be available on Manifold any day now. I did learn a lot about copyrights and licenses from Adam and Joanna, I believe, when they came and did a presentation within that class. The other time that I've been published was through my internship, and it is actually online in addition to being in print. That was a great experience because it focused more on the research and background that goes into writing a piece, but I did not have to do much in terms of the actual publication of the piece. So, I'm not sure that what I did in my internship is entirely applicable in the field of digital humanities, and I feel a little out of my comfort zone as a result. 

## Concerns? 
One concern of mine is certainly keeping up with the technology part. While I can certainly hold my own in reading, writing, and research, I am out of practice with technology and computer programs. 

## Anything exciting? 
I'm excited about being published again, as that is a really cool opportunity. I also think that working in a small team like this could be really great as well; I'm sure that I can learn from Paxton and Sam too!
